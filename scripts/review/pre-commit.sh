# Auto-review gate (pre-commit).  The same gate cl-amiga uses, adapted to
# clamacs: it reviews the STAGED diff with a headless `claude`, and if the
# review is clean the commit proceeds untouched; if it finds problems and
# AUTO_FIX is on, a fix agent edits the affected files, the fixes are
# re-staged, and the commit proceeds WITH the fixes included.  Then it runs
# the host test suite.
#
# Design principles:
#   * Review + tests are MANDATORY. Fail-CLOSED: a reviewer error, timeout, or
#     missing tool BLOCKS the commit — it is never silently skipped. The only
#     bypass is an explicit `git commit --no-verify`.
#   * The staged diff is written to a file and the reviewer is told to READ it
#     (with Read+Grep+Glob tools — no shell), NOT piped on stdin. Headless
#     `claude -p` stalls when a large diff arrives on stdin and it must answer
#     in a single shot; reading the diff as a file lets the agent work through
#     it reliably.
#   * Never sweep in changes the user didn't stage (partial-staging guard).
#   * The INDEX the user staged is what gets committed.  The reviewer has no
#     shell, and the staged tree + HEAD are snapshotted before any agent runs:
#     a moved index is restored with `git read-tree`, a moved HEAD blocks the
#     commit (index guard).
#
# clamacs note: `make test` builds and runs the host suite (the portable core
# under src/emacs, src/lisp, src/rexx).  It does NOT cross-compile the MUI
# half; a break there shows only in `make -f Makefile.cross amiga`, which needs
# the m68k toolchain and is slower.  Set CLAUDE_TEST_TARGET if you want a
# different target.  The review step reads the whole diff, MUI half included.
#
# Override behaviour via env vars (see scripts/review/README.md):
#   CLAUDE_AUTO_REVIEW=0   disable entirely (or use `git commit --no-verify`)
#   CLAUDE_AUTO_FIX=0      review + block on issues, but don't auto-fix
#   CLAUDE_REVIEW_MODEL    default: sonnet
#   CLAUDE_FIX_MODEL       default: sonnet
#   CLAUDE_REVIEW_TIMEOUT  default: 5400  (seconds = 90 min, if `timeout`/`gtimeout`
#                          exists; the agentic Read+grep review and the fix agent
#                          can each take many minutes)
#   CLAUDE_TEST_TARGET     default: test
#
# Note: --max-budget-usd is intentionally NOT passed. It only caps pay-per-token
# API-call spend (and only with --print); it does nothing for a subscription
# (claude.ai) login, which is metered by plan rate limits, not dollars.

REVIEW_PROMPT='You are reviewing a git diff for a commit about to be made to clamacs, an Emacs-flavoured Common Lisp IDE for AmigaOS 3 and MorphOS: a native C MUI editor that drives a running clamiga (the CL-Amiga runtime) over ARexx. The staged diff to review is in the file '"$DIFF_FILE"' — read that file first.

Enforce these project rules (from CLAUDE.md and specs/clamacs-ide.md):
- Two processes, one job each: the editor is native C, the Lisp lives in clamiga. Editor/redisplay/buffer logic must NOT be moved into Lisp.
- The host-testable core (src/emacs, src/lisp, src/rexx) must stay free of MUI and OS types — it may not include clamacs.h or any <proto/*>, <mui/*>, <exec/*> header. Code that needs OS types belongs in the MUI half (main/textclass/document/introspect/rexxclient/rexxport/errorwin).
- C89/C99 only; the target is built at -Os with no LTO (this m68k gcc miscompiles at -O2 and -flto is broken). No C11+ features.
- Sized integers (uint32_t/int32_t) everywhere that crosses the OS boundary; no size_t or pointer-sized fields in anything shared with the OS or the wire.
- TextEditor.mcc is subclassed at runtime, never forked or built; do not add a build of the class.
- ARexx client rules: never block the MUI loop waiting for a reply; every MUI ARexx command hook returns LONG 0 explicitly; export with the NoStyle hook; save and restore MUIA_TextEditor_HasChanged around a SetBlock that only paints; never dispose a window from a notification hook.
- New clamiga capabilities are commits in cl-amiga under its own gates, not editor-side workarounds.
- Every feature/bugfix needs a test where the code is host-testable; a bug fix needs a regression test.

Output format, STRICTLY:
- The FIRST line must be exactly "STATUS: CLEAN" or "STATUS: ISSUES".
- If ISSUES, follow with a markdown list, one item per finding:
  "- [HIGH|MED|LOW] path:line - problem - suggested fix"
- Report ONLY substantive problems (bugs, memory/32-bit, C89/C99, the two-process/host-core split, ARexx-loop blocking, MUI lifecycle, missing/incorrect tests, security). No style nits, no speculation.
- Read the diff file and any surrounding source files you need for context (Read tool); use Grep/Glob to search the tree and verify claims. You have no shell: do not try to build, run tests, or run git — you are inside a pre-commit hook and the hook runs the tests itself after you. Do NOT edit anything.'

# No stdin: the diff is read from $DIFF_FILE. Redirect </dev/null so headless
# claude doesn't wait on (or block reading) an empty stdin.  Read+Grep+Glob
# only: the agent can read the diff/sources and search the tree, but has NO
# shell (a reviewer with Bash could run git and move the index/HEAD).

- Then append under that finding in the log: "  - RESOLVED: <what you changed>". If a finding is a false positive, append "  - DISMISSED: <why>" and change no code for it.
